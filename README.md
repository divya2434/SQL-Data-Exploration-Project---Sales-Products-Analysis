This repository contains a collection of advanced SQL queries performed on three datasets:

raw_sales_large

products_large

frequent_buyer_per_month

Key business questions answered using SQL include:

🔍 Identifying unique products sold by each merchant

🥇 Top-selling product categories by revenue per merchant

📅 Daily revenue trends and merchant performance

📈 Category-wise peak sales dates

🧮 Revenue percentile analysis for top products

📦 Category-level and merchant-level product rankings

🔁 Detecting duplicate or missing transaction records

❌ Flagging invalid sales data

The project showcases the use of:

Joins & Aggregations

Window Functions (RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), DENSE_RANK(), LAG())

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Percentile analysis using PERCENTILE_CONT

Data quality checks (invalid/duplicate/missing data)

Useful for learning SQL applied to real-world sales analytics scenarios.
